What sect do you belong too?

I'll give you one guess.

Your a farmer right?
So, Jiutian Limited?

Right on target.
How about you?

I'm from Vahagna Corp.

Really?
You don't seem like it.

Why not?

I haven't to many people from the sect, but they all seems so combative and height and mighty.
Where as you seem kinder and caring.

I know what you mean.
But were not all blood sheed.
Protection and justice are also part of our domain.
I want to became a detective.

What a dream!
I love true crime podcast.

We should solve this mystery together!
After that we could both beacome becaome detective together.
We would make a great dynamic due.

Can I really help you solve the mystery?

Of course, I would love your help!

As much as I would like to follow you, I'm needed back at the farm.

Who cares!
What do you think about this mystery?

I would't want to suspect anyone of board.
They all seem like such nice people!

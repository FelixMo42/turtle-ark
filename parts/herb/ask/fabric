Do you have any idea what this is?
Camille found it in the water pump.

Ahh, I think I've seen this before!
Back many years ago, in my home town, there was a civial war.
I had been training as a pilot for the post office at as the time, so I was quikly recruted into the army.

I want to fly some day!
I'd like to join the Vahagna air division at some point.

This was actually before Vahagna saved the world.
Back then he was just a young man filled with gumpshion following his dream.

How old are you?

Didn't you know it rude to ask a women that.

But your not a women...

I've been many things throught out my life.
Now back to the story.
I had joined the army and was positioned on a small make shift air field near some farms.
One day, while I was out hunting I heard a huge explostion.
I ran back to base as fast as I could, but I was too late.
It was nothing but a smoldering hole.
When I was looking thought the rubble, I found the same sort of canvas scraps.

Did you even find out what happened?

No, I was captured by enemy forces the next day!

Thanks for the info.
I'm sure I'll track down the culprit soon!

I'm sure you will.

Can you think of any reason someone might want to blow up your pump?

The pump belongs to the Nepots trading company.
I'm just there employ.

My question still stands, is there any reason someone might want to destroy the pump?

Water is a prescous resoure in the desert.
Part of my jobs is to take it from point a to b.
No matter what you do, people will allways be unhappy.

Is there anybody on board.

No way, I vetted everyone on board carfully.
My guess is that it was the Sand Feiry?

Sand Feiry?

Have you never heard of the Sand Feirys!

Don't worry about my job.
I've allready lived more lifetimes than most.
But if you want to investigate, have fun!

What sect do you belong too?

I'm origonally of the Vahagna Corp, but now I belong to The Nyami & Nyami Group.

Why did you switch?

I was once a great bounty hunter.
I traveled the three lands, fighting terrible monsters.
But, my goal was allways the evil archer known as Cupid.
My quest was rentless.
I found clues and stocked them accross the lands.
Then, when I least expected it, they ambushed me at my camp.
The battle was epic.
It raged on for days.
But, in the end, I was defeated and left the Vahagna Corp in shame.

You must have been incredible!
Its a shame you decided to leave.
Why did you decied to join N&N afterwards?

Well, I couldnt walk as well after I took an arrow to the knee, but I needed work.
Luckily a position at a power plant opened up, and I've been with Nyami & Nyami ever since.

How did you come to be working on this turtle?

Thats a story for a diffrent time.

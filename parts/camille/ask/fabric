What do you think about the fabric you found in the water pump?

I had a closer look at it.
There was some traces of amonium nitrate on it.
Seems like it was part of some sort of explosive.

I gussed that much.
Any idea how it got in there?

I did my last check the day before yesterday, so any time between then and this morning.

When were you not in the room?

Why?

I want to narrow down when someone could have done this.

Allright.
I was out for lunch and dinner.
Also, I was away for about two hours to talk to herb.
I hope that helps.

Definitely!
This will be a huge help.
